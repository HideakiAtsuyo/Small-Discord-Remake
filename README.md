## I Want To Give You My Idea

If you want to give a idea you can [Click here](https://github.com/HideakiAtsuyo/Small-Discord-Remake/issues/new?title=%3CMy%20Idea%20Name%3E&body=%3CMy%20Idea%20Description%3E) and fill the Title & Description 

## Small Useless Detail

Probably one day I will make a "serious" remake of Discord(kinda remake it completelly but not with the goal to use it in PRODUCTION environment !) as simple as possible (not as some other remake levels for example that are much more "advanced" as it would be hard for everyone to understand)
